gmetric-daemon is my attempt at a forking standalone daemon
for ganglia users that want to write additional metric monitors
in Python. 

Perhaps this project isn't need if using the gmond python module interface.
I wanted a multithreaded approach to monitoring... but it turns out
that Python threads really suck. So I made this a forking daemon.
One process per module. Not very memory effecient. But then I don't
expect to need many modules. Perhaps ThreadedPython could be used
since it doesn't suffer from the GIL.

I'm hoping that this will make it easier to write
metric modules for things like database monitoring.
